# Threads

## Overview:
Threads is a web3 Solana program designed to create a decentralized alternative to traditional social networking platforms like LinkedIn. Built on the Solana blockchain, Threads allows users to create accounts, make posts, and interact with posts from other users. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions for running it on the Solana Devnet.

## Getting Started:
To run Threads locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/threads.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the app directory:
    ```bash
    cd app
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Usage:
Once the development server is running, you can access Threads through your web browser at http://localhost:3000. From there, you can create an account, make posts, and view posts from other users.
